### Technical Details

#### Markdown Rendering Migration
The migration from `flutter_markdown` to `markdown` package provides several benefits:

**Before (flutter_markdown):**
```dart
MarkdownBody(
  data: content,
  styleSheet: MarkdownStyleSheet(...),
  onTapLink: (text, href, title) => {...},
)
```

**After (custom markdown renderer):**
```dart
_MarkdownRenderer(
  content: content,
  onLinkTap: (href) => {...},
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduced dependency footprint
- Better control over rendering and styling
