# WebSocket Service Enhancement Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing WebSocket service enhancements for message sequencing and acknowledgment in the Helpy Ninja project.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Message Entity Enhancement
- ✅ Added WebSocket-specific fields to Message entity:
  - `messageId`: Unique identifier for message tracking
  - `sentAt`: Timestamp when message was sent
  - `deliveredAt`: Timestamp when message was delivered
  - `readAt`: Timestamp when message was read
  - `deliveryStatus`: Status of message delivery (sending, sent, delivered, read, failed, acknowledged)
- ✅ Updated Message constructor to accommodate new fields
- ✅ Updated copyWith, toJson, and fromJson methods to handle new fields

### 2. MessageDeliveryStatus Enum
- ✅ Added new enum `MessageDeliveryStatus` to shared_enums.dart:
  - `sending`: Message is being sent
  - `sent`: Message sent to server
  - `delivered`: Message delivered to recipients
  - `read`: Message read by recipients
  - `failed`: Message failed to send
  - `acknowledged`: Message acknowledged by recipients

### 3. WebSocket Service Enhancement
- ✅ Added acknowledgment tracking mechanism
- ✅ Implemented message sequencing with automatic sequence number generation
- ✅ Added message tracking with retry mechanism
- ✅ Implemented acknowledgment timeout handling
- ✅ Added message acknowledgment protocol
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for message delivery issues
- ✅ Updated dispose method to properly clean up resources

### 4. New Classes
- ✅ Added `MessageAcknowledgment` class for handling message acknowledgments
- ✅ Added `_PendingMessage` internal class for tracking pending messages

### 5. Testing
- ✅ Created unit tests for WebSocket service enhancements
- ✅ Verified all existing tests still pass
- ✅ Confirmed proper resource cleanup in dispose method

## Implementation Details

### Message Sequencing
The WebSocket service now automatically generates sequence numbers for outgoing messages, ensuring proper ordering even when messages arrive out of order.

### Acknowledgment System
A comprehensive acknowledgment system has been implemented:
1. Messages are tracked after sending
2. Acknowledgments are expected from recipients
3. Timeout mechanism handles unacknowledged messages
4. Automatic retry mechanism for failed deliveries
5. Proper error reporting for persistent failures

### Resource Management
All new resources including timers, streams, and tracking data structures are properly disposed of to prevent memory leaks.

## Files Modified

### Domain Layer
1. `domain/entities/message.dart` - Added WebSocket-specific fields
2. `domain/entities/shared_enums.dart` - Added MessageDeliveryStatus enum

### Service Layer
1. `services/websocket_service.dart` - Enhanced with sequencing and acknowledgment

### Test Layer
1. `test/services/websocket_service_test.dart` - Added unit tests

## Next Steps

### Integration with Group Session Notifier
- Update GroupSessionNotifier to integrate with enhanced WebSocket service
- Handle message acknowledgments in the UI
- Update message status based on acknowledgments

### UI Enhancements
- Add visual indicators for message delivery status
- Implement user feedback for failed message deliveries
- Add retry options for failed messages

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize message tracking for large group sessions
- Implement efficient acknowledgment handling
- Minimize memory usage for message tracking

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- ✅ Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- ✅ Proper documentation and comments
- ✅ No analyzer warnings or errors

### Testing
- ✅ Unit tests pass with 100% success rate
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup verified

## Success Criteria Status

1. ✅ Messages are sent with unique sequence numbers
2. ✅ Message acknowledgments are properly handled
3. ✅ Failed messages are retried automatically
4. ✅ All existing functionality continues to work without issues
5. ✅ Unit tests pass with >80% coverage
6. ✅ No analyzer warnings or errors
7. ✅ Performance is acceptable with high message volume

## Risk Mitigation

1. ✅ Maintain backward compatibility with existing messages
2. ✅ Implement thorough error handling for edge cases
3. ✅ Test with various network conditions and message delivery patterns
4. ✅ Document all changes for future maintenance
