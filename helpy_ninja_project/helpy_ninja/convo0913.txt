     group study sessions. The platform's unique value proposition is multi-agent LLM interactions where multiple Helpys collaborate in group chats, creating unprecedented
     social learning dynamics.
     ## Core Vision
     Transform education through AI tutors that don't just teach content, but build genuine learning relationships with students while facilitating collaborative peer learning
     through multi-agent AI interactions.
     ## Target Markets
     - **Primary**: Vietnamese students learning English (mobile-first, affordable pricing)

     # Helpy Ninja - Product Context
     ## Product Definition & Purpose
     ### What is Helpy Ninja?
     Helpy Ninja is an AI-powered educational platform that provides personalized tutoring through AI agents called "Helpys." Each student receives their own Helpy that learns
     their personality, strengths, weaknesses, and builds a genuine learning relationship over time.
     ### Revolutionary Multi-Agent Learning
     The platform's breakthrough innovation is group learning sessions where multiple students' Helpys participate simultaneously, creating unprecedented AI-to-AI educational
     collaboration while facilitating human peer learning.

     ## Overall Architecture Philosophy
     ### Clean Architecture Principles
     The system follows Clean Architecture with clear separation of concerns:
     - **Presentation Layer**: Controllers, WebSocket handlers, DTOs
     - **Application Layer**: Services, use cases, business logic coordination
     - **Domain Layer**: Entities, value objects, domain services, repository interfaces
     - **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository implementations, external service integrations

> You put it in the wrong folder. It supposed to be /home/mcesel/Documents/helpy/helpy_ninja_project/helpy_ninja/helpy_backend/memory-bank

● You're absolutely right! I put the Memory Bank files in the wrong location. Let me move them to the correct folder:
  /home/mcesel/Documents/helpy/helpy_ninja_project/helpy_ninja/helpy_backend/memory-bank/

● Bash(mkdir -p /home/mcesel/Documents/helpy/helpy_ninja_project/helpy_ninja/helpy_backend/memory-bank)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(mv /home/mcesel/Documents/helpy/helpy_ninja_project/helpy_backend/memory-bank/* /home/mcesel/Documents/helpy/helpy_ninja_project/helpy_ninja/helpy_backend/memor…)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Bash(ls -la /home/mcesel/Documents/helpy/helpy_ninja_project/helpy_ninja/helpy_backend/memory-bank/)
  ⎿  total 76                                        
     drwxrwxr-x 2 mcesel mcesel  4096 Sep 13 11:43 .
     drwxrwxr-x 6 mcesel mcesel  4096 Sep 13 10:00 ..
     … +6 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Bash(rmdir /home/mcesel/Documents/helpy/helpy_ninja_project/helpy_backend/memory-bank)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Perfect! ✅ I've successfully moved all the Memory Bank files to the correct location:

  Corrected Location: /home/mcesel/Documents/helpy/helpy_ninja_project/helpy_ninja/helpy_backend/memory-bank/

  All 6 Memory Bank files are now in the proper directory:
  - ✅ projectbrief.md
  - ✅ productContext.md
  - ✅ systemPatterns.md
  - ✅ techContext.md
  - ✅ activeContext.md
  - ✅ progress.md

  The Memory Bank is now correctly positioned within the helpy_ninja project structure and ready to support the backend development work. Thank you for catching that error!

> Please read the contents of helpy_backend/memory-bank. Then 1) determine the next task. 2)Skim through the codebase in helpy_backend/src/main/java/ . 3) Generate an 
  emplementation plan. Ensure the plan is inline with the project docs in the memory-bank. 4) Implement the plan in accordance with the Daily workflow procedures and always run 
  linter checks. Ensure compatibility with the frontend 5) Write and conduct testing on the Implementation. 6) Document progress, test results and update project documents.
