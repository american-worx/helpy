## Implementation Details

### Core Components Implemented

1. **GroupSession Entity**
   - Complete domain model for group sessions
   - Participant tracking with status management
   - JSON serialization for storage and API communication

2. **Shared Enums**
   - GroupSessionStatus (active, paused, completed, cancelled)
   - ParticipantStatus (active, inactive, left, disconnected)

3. **State Management**
   - GroupSessionState for managing group session state
   - GroupSessionNotifier for Riverpod state management
   - Provider files for exporting notifiers and convenience providers

4. **WebSocket Service Enhancement**
   - Added new message types for participant synchronization: `participant_added`, `participant_removed`
   - Implemented methods to send participant change notifications
   - Added `ParticipantChangeEvent` class to represent participant changes
   - Added `participantChangeStream` to listen for participant change events

5. **Localization**
   - Added group session related localization keys to both English and Vietnamese ARB files
   - Fixed key consistency issues between the two files
   - Resolved conflicts with reserved words in localization keys

### Testing

#### GroupSession Entity Tests (12/12 passing)
- GroupSession creation with valid data
- Owner identification
- Participant identification
- Participant count calculation
- Helpy count calculation
- Active participant retrieval
- Recent message retrieval
- JSON conversion (to/from)
- Copy with updated properties
- GroupSession comparison
- GroupSessionStatus enum values
- ParticipantStatus enum values

#### GroupSessionNotifier Tests (8/8 passing)
- Default state initialization
- Group session creation
- Session joining
- Session leaving
- Message sending
- Session settings update
- Error state clearing
- Data refresh

#### MultiAgentCoordinator Tests (7/7 passing)
- Session addition and removal
- Response permission granting
- Response permission denial
- Response queuing
- Conflict resolution
- Conversation flow management
- Session status retrieval

#### HelpyIndicator Tests (6/6 passing)
- Default rendering
- Name display functionality
- Status display functionality
- Localization support

## Issues Resolved

1. **Localization Key Conflicts**
   - Fixed issue with "of" key conflicting with AppLocalizations.of method
   - Changed key to "oF" in both ARB files

2. **ARV File Inconsistency**
   - Ensured both English and Vietnamese ARB files have the same keys
   - Added missing keys to Vietnamese file with appropriate translations

3. **State Management Issues**
   - Fixed clearError method not properly clearing error state
   - Implemented direct state creation instead of copyWith for null handling

4. **Code Quality Issues**
   - Resolved all analyzer warnings and errors
   - Fixed unused element warnings
   - Improved code organization and maintainability

## Test Results Summary
