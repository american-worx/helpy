### 3. Mock Entities for Testing
- Mock Helpy personalities with different traits and specializations
- Mock users with varying interaction patterns
- Mock group session scenarios with different complexities
- Mock network conditions for robustness testing

### 4. Test Scenarios:
1. **Basic Coordination**: 2 Helpys coordinating in a simple conversation
2. **Complex Coordination**: 4 Helpys with different personalities in a technical discussion
3. **Turn-taking Stress Test**: All Helpys attempting to respond simultaneously
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Testing scenarios where Helpys have conflicting responses
5. **Attention Management**: Ensuring balanced participation across Helpys with different engagement levels
6. **Permission System**: Testing permission requests, grants, and timeouts

## Quality Gates

Before proceeding to Task 8.2, all of the following criteria must be met:

1. ✅ MultiAgentCoordinator class fully implemented
2. ✅ Turn-taking algorithm working correctly
3. ✅ Response permission system preventing overlaps
4. ✅ Conflict resolution handling edge cases
5. ✅ Attention management ensuring balanced participation
6. ✅ All tests passing with 95%+ coverage
7. ✅ No critical bugs in issue tracker
8. ✅ Documentation updated

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Coordination Complexity**: Implement thorough testing of coordination algorithms
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Build in timeout mechanisms and deadlock detection
- **Performance Impact**: Optimize algorithms to minimize latency
- **Scalability**: Design with horizontal scaling in mind

### Mitigation Strategies:
